- Use ES Modules only (`import`/`export`) and `.js` files.
- Style: 2-space indentation, semicolons, single quotes.
- Keep functions small/focused.
- Command files named by action (e.g. `create.js`), exported handler names as `<name>Command`.
- Utility names are verb-first (e.g. `loadConfig`, `createWorktree`).
- Prefer explicit CLI-facing error messages.
